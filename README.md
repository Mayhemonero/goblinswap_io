# GoblinSwap Reserve Scanner

A small browser script to scan GoblinSwap pages for **reserves, liquidity numbers, and pool balances**.  

It’s **read-only** and only scrapes numbers from the page text—no API calls, no wallet interactions, no real swaps. Just a way to peek at the numbers without touching anything.  

## Features

- Finds page sections mentioning: `reserve`, `reserves`, `liquidity`, `balance`, `pool`  
- Extracts any numbers in those sections  
- Prints results in a simple console table  
- Works entirely in your browser console  

## Usage

1. Open GoblinSwap.io  
2. Open developer console (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I`)  
3. Paste the script and hit Enter  
4. Wait a few seconds for results to appear
